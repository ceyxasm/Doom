# An App Designed to send recurrent emails
We have used Nodejs to make our web app.
Signup page is up. however we havent added the functionality to add new users.
Sumbitting credentials on sign up page will lead to login page

Right now, only one user can access the application
Username: mark121wood@gmail.com
Password: doomdoom

this should lead you to our mail page
Now again, you can send mail only using mark121wood@gmail.com
You can send it to any one.
